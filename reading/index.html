# Random Matrices, Matrix Concentration and Related Topics#
Organizers: Jatin Batra (jatin.batra at cwi dot nl) and Makrand Sinha (makrand.sinha at cwi dot nl)

## Time and Location
Usually we meet on Fridays at 1.30pm in L16

## Description

This reading group will focus on various topics in random matrices, matrix concentration and related topics. As all these subjects are very broad, we will only be able to touch on some aspects. The current plan is to have the reading group in two parts, part I will focus on some of the foundational stuff and will run from late September to early December. Part II will run from January to April/May and will focus on selected advanced papers.
