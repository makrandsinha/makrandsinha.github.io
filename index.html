We give an example of a boolean function whose information complexity is exponentially smaller than its communication complexity. This was first proven recently by Ganor, Kol and Raz (J. ACM 2016) and our work gives a simpler proof of the same result. In the course of this simplification, we make several new contributions: we introduce a new communication lower bound technique, the notion of a <em>fooling distribution</em>, which allows us to separate information and communication complexity, and we also give a more direct proof for the information complexity upper bound. We also prove a generalization of Shearer's Lemma that may be of independent interest.

	We study the problem of estimating the number of edges in a graph with access to only an independent set oracle. Independent set queries draw motivation from group testing and have applications to the complexity of decision versus counting problems. We give two algorithms to estimate the number of edges in an \(n\)-vertex graph: one that uses only \(\mathrm{polylog}(n)\) bipartite independent set queries, and another one that uses \({n}^{2/3} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(n)\) independent set queries.

	We prove that any extended formulation that approximates the matching polytope on \(n\)-vertex graphs up to a factor of \((1+\epsilon)\) for any \(\frac2n \le \epsilon \le 1\) must have at least \({n} \choose {{\alpha}/{\epsilon}}\) defining inequalities where \(0<\alpha<1\) is an absolute constant. This is tight as exhibited by the \((1+\epsilon)\) approximating linear program obtained by dropping the odd set constraints of size larger than \(({1+\epsilon})/{\epsilon}\) from the description of the matching polytope. Previously, a tight lower bound of \(2^{\Omega(n)}\) was only known for \(\epsilon = O\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\) [Rothvoss, STOC '14; Braun and Pokutta, IEEE Trans. Information Theory '15] whereas for \(\frac2n \le \epsilon \le 1\), the best lower bound was \(2^{\Omega\left({1}/{\epsilon}\right)}\) [Rothvoss, STOC '14]. The key new ingredient in our proof is a close connection to the non-negative rank of a lopsided version of the unique disjointness matrix.

We study a direct-sum question for read-once branching programs. If \(M(f)\) denotes the minimum average memory required to compute a function \(f(x_1,x_2, \dotsc, x_n)\)  how much memory is required to compute \(f\) on \(k\) independent inputs that arrive in parallel? We show that when the inputs (updates) are sampled independently from some domain \(\mathcal{X}\) and \(M(f) = \Omega(n)\), then computing the value of \(f\) on \(k\) streams requires average memory at least \(\Omega\left(k \cdot \frac{M(f)}{n}\right)\).
<br>

Our results are obtained by defining new ways to measure the information complexity of read-once branching programs. We define two such measures: the <em>transitional</em> and <em>cumulative</em> information content. We prove that any read-once branching program with transitional information content \(\mathtt{I}\) can be simulated using average memory \(\mathcal{O}(n(\mathtt{I}+1))\). On the other hand, if every read-once branching program with cumulative information content \(\mathtt{I}\) can be simulated with average memory \(\mathcal{O}(\mathtt{I}+1)\), then computing \(f\) on \(k\) inputs requires average memory at least \(\Omega(k \cdot (M(f)-1))\).

	Fooling pairs are one of the standard methods for proving lower
bounds for deterministic two-player communication complexity.
We study fooling pairs in the context of randomized communication complexity.
We show that every fooling pair induces far away distributions
on transcripts of private-coin protocols.
We then conclude that the private-coin randomized \(\varepsilon\)-error
communication complexity of a function \(f\) with a fooling set
\(\mathcal{S}\) is at least order \(\log \frac{\log |\mathcal{S}|}{\varepsilon}\).
This is tight, for example, for the equality 
and greater-than functions.

	We show that a black-box construction of a pseudorandom generator from a one-way function needs to make \(\Omega(n/log(n))\) calls to the underlying one-way function. The bound even holds if the one-way function is guaranteed to be regular. In this case it matches the best known construction due to Goldreich, Krawczyk, and Luby (SIAM J. Comp. 22, 1993), which uses \(\mathcal{O}(n/log(n))\) calls.

<p>Let \(\mathcal{H}_n\) be the class of unlabeled trees with \(n\) vertices, and denote by \(\mathcal{H}_n\) a tree that is drawn uniformly at random from this set.

This result provides a very precise characterization of the ``central region'' of the distribution, but does not give any non-trivial information about its tails.

In this work we study further the number of vertices of degree \(k\) in \(\mathcal{H}_n\).
