We show that concrete hardness assumptions about learning or cloning the output state of a random quantum circuit can be used as the foundation for secure quantum cryptography. In particular, under these assumptions we construct secure one-way state generators (OWSGs), digital signature schemes, quantum bit commitments, and private key encryption schemes. We also discuss evidence for these hardness assumptions by analyzing the best-known quantum learning algorithms, as well as proving black-box lower bounds for cloning and learning given state preparation oracles. Our random circuit-based constructions provide concrete instantiations of quantum cryptographic primitives whose security do not depend on the existence of one-way functions. The use of random circuits in our constructions also opens the door to NISQ-friendly quantum cryptography. We discuss noise tolerant versions of our OWSG and digital signature constructions which can potentially be implementable on noisy quantum computers connected by a quantum network. On the other hand, they are still secure against noiseless quantum adversaries, raising the intriguing possibility of a useful implementation of an end-to-end cryptographic protocol on near-term quantum computers. Finally, our explorations suggest that the rich interconnections between learning theory and cryptography in classical theoretical computer science also extend to the quantum setting.

Uniformly random unitaries, i.e. unitaries drawn from the Haar measure, have many useful properties, but cannot be implemented efficiently. This has motivated a long line of research into random unitaries that "look" sufficiently Haar random while also being efficient to implement.

In this work, we take a unified approach to constructing \(t\)-designs and PRUs. For this, we introduce and analyse the "\(PFC\) ensemble", the product of a random computational basis permutation \(P\), a random binary phase operator \(F\), and a random Clifford unitary \(C\). We show that this ensemble reproduces exponentially high moments of the Haar measure. We can then derandomise the \(PFC\) ensemble to show the following:

    <li> <strong>Linear-depth \(t\)-designs.</strong> We give the first construction of a (diamond-error) approximate \(t\)-design with circuit depth linear in \(t\).

     <p>Motivated by limitations on the depth of near-term quantum devices, we study the depth-computation trade-off in the query model, where the depth corresponds to the number of adaptive query rounds and the computation per layer corresponds to the number of parallel queries per round. We achieve the strongest known separation between quantum algorithms with \(r\) versus \(r−1\) rounds of adaptivity. We do so by using the \(k\)-fold Forrelation problem introduced by Aaronson and Ambainis (SICOMP'18).

     Collision-resistant hashing, a fundamental primitive in modern cryptography, ensures that there is no efficient way to find distinct inputs that produce the same hash value. This property underpins the security of various cryptographic applications, making it crucial to understand its complexity. The complexity of this problem is well-understood in the classical setting and \(\Theta(N^{1/2})\) queries are needed to find a collision. However, the advent of quantum computing has introduced new challenges since quantum adversaries --- equipped with the power of quantum queries --- can find collisions much more efficiently. Brassard, Høyer and Tapp and Aaronson and Shi established that full-scale quantum adversaries require \(\Theta(N^{1/3})\) queries to find a collision, prompting a need for longer hash outputs, which impacts efficiency in terms of the key lengths needed for security.</p>

<li> A hybrid algorithm making adaptive quantum or classical queries but with a limited quantum query budget, or
<li> quantum algorithm with access to a noisy oracle, or
<li> hybrid algorithm with an upper bound on its maximum quantum depth; i.e. a classical algorithm aided by low-depth quantum circuits.

The main feature of this framework is that it allows us to record queries in two incompatible bases --- classical queries in the standard basis and quantum queries in the Fourier basis --- consistently. We call the framework the <em>hybrid compressed oracle</em> as it naturally interpolates between the classical way of recording queries and the compressed oracle framework of Zhandry for recording quantum queries.

	<p> We consider an {online vector balancing} question where \(T\) vectors, chosen from an {arbitrary} distribution over \([-1,1]^n\), arrive one-by-one and must be immediately given a \(\pm\) sign. The goal is to keep the {discrepancy}---the \(\ell_{\infty}\)-norm of any signed prefix-sum---as small as possible. A concrete example of this question is the {online interval discrepancy} problem where \(T\) points are sampled one-by-one uniformly in the unit interval \([0,1]\), and the goal is to immediately color them \(\pm\) such that every sub-interval remains always nearly balanced. As random coloring incurs \(\Omega(T^{1/2})\) discrepancy, while the offline bounds are \(\Theta((n\log T)^{1/2})\) for vector balancing and \(1\) for interval balancing, a natural question is whether one can (nearly) match the offline bounds in the online setting for these problems. One must utilize the stochasticity as in the worst-case scenario it is known that discrepancy is \(\Omega(T^{1/2})\) for any online algorithm.</p>

    <p> In a special case of online vector balancing, Bansal and Spencer (arXiv '19)} recently show an \(O(\sqrt{n}\log T)\) bound when each coordinate is <em>independently</em> chosen. When there are <em>dependencies</em> among the coordinates, as in the interval discrepancy problem, the problem becomes much more challenging, as evidenced by a recent work of Jiang, Kulkarni, and Singla (arXiv '19) that gives a non-trivial \(O(T^{1/\log\log T})\) bound for  online interval discrepancy. Although this beats random coloring, it is still far from the offline bound.</p>
    <p>
    In this work, we introduce a new framework that allows us to handle online vector balancing even when the input distribution has {dependencies} across coordinates. In particular, this lets us obtain a \(\mathrm{poly}(n, \log T)\) bound for online vector balancing under arbitrary input distributions, and a \(\mathrm{polylog} (T)\) bound for online interval discrepancy. Our framework is powerful enough to capture other well-studied geometric discrepancy problems; e.g., we obtain a \(\mathrm{poly}(\log^d (T))\) bound for the online \(d\)-dimensional Tusn&aacute;dy's problem. All our bounds are tight up to polynomial factors.</p>
    <p>
    A key new technical ingredient in our work is an <em>anti-concentration</em> inequality for sums of pairwise uncorrelated random variables, which might also be of independent interest.

A concrete example of this question is the {online interval discrepancy} problem where \(T\) points are sampled one-by-one uniformly in the unit interval \([0,1]\), and the goal is to immediately color them \(\pm\) such that every sub-interval remains always nearly balanced. As random coloring incurs \(\Omega(T^{1/2})\) discrepancy, while the offline bounds are \(\Theta((n\log T)^{1/2})\) for vector balancing and \(1\) for interval balancing, a natural question is whether one can (nearly) match the offline bounds in the online setting for these problems. One must utilize the stochasticity as in the worst-case scenario it is known that discrepancy is \(\Omega(T^{1/2})\) for any online algorithm.</p>

    <p> In a special case of online vector balancing, Bansal and Spencer (arXiv '19)} recently show an \(O(\sqrt{n}\log T)\) bound when each coordinate is <em>independently</em> chosen. When there are <em>dependencies</em> among the coordinates, as in the interval discrepancy problem, the problem becomes much more challenging, as evidenced by a recent work of Jiang, Kulkarni, and Singla (arXiv '19) that gives a non-trivial \(O(T^{1/\log\log T})\) bound for  online interval discrepancy. Although this beats random coloring, it is still far from the offline bound.</p>
    <p>
    In this work, we introduce a new framework that allows us to handle online vector balancing even when the input distribution has {dependencies} across coordinates. In particular, this lets us obtain a \(\poly(n, \log T)\) bound for online vector balancing under arbitrary input distributions, and a \(\polylog (T)\) bound for online interval discrepancy. Our framework is powerful enough to capture other well-studied geometric discrepancy problems; e.g., we obtain a \(\poly(\log^d (T))\) bound for the online \(d\)-dimensional Tus\'nady's problem. All our bounds are tight up to polynomial factors.</p>
    <p>
    A key new technical ingredient in our work is an <em>anti-concentration</em> inequality for sums of pairwise uncorrelated random variables, which might also be of independent interest.

    We give an example of a boolean function whose information complexity is exponentially smaller than its communication complexity. This was first proven recently by Ganor, Kol and Raz (J. ACM 2016) and our work gives a simpler proof of the same result. In the course of this simplification, we make several new contributions: we introduce a new communication lower bound technique, the notion of a <em>fooling distribution</em>, which allows us to separate information and communication complexity, and we also give a more direct proof for the information complexity upper bound.</p> 

    <p> We also prove a generalization of Shearer's Lemma that may be of independent interest. A version of Shearer's original lemma bounds the expected mutual information of a subset of random variables with another random variable, when the subset is chosen independently of all the random variables that are involved. Our generalization allows some dependence between the random subset and the random variables involved, and still gives us similar bounds with an appropriate error term.

We study a direct-sum question for read-once branching programs. If \(M(f)\) denotes the minimum average memory required to compute a function \(f(x_1,x_2, \dotsc, x_n)\)  how much memory is required to compute \(f\) on \(k\) independent inputs that arrive in parallel? We show that when the inputs (updates) are sampled independently from some domain \(\mathcal{X}\) and \(M(f) = \Omega(n)\), then computing the value of \(f\) on \(k\) streams requires average memory at least \(\Omega\left(k \cdot \frac{M(f)}{n}\right)\).

Our results are obtained by defining new ways to measure the information complexity of read-once branching programs. We define two such measures: the <em>transitional</em> and <em>cumulative</em> information content. We prove that any read-once branching program with transitional information content \(\mathtt{I}\) can be simulated using average memory \(\mathcal{O}(n(\mathtt{I}+1))\). On the other hand, if every read-once branching program with cumulative information content \(\mathtt{I}\) can be simulated with average memory \(\mathcal{O}(\mathtt{I}+1)\), then computing \(f\) on \(k\) inputs requires average memory at least \(\Omega(k \cdot (M(f)-1))\).

We study fooling pairs in the context of randomized communication complexity.
We show that every fooling pair induces far away distributions

We then conclude that the private-coin randomized \(\varepsilon\)-error
